**Date**: 2025-01-02  
**Feature**: 020-i18n-readme

## No API Changes Required

This feature focuses on UI internationalization and documentation updates. No API changes are required for this feature.

### Existing API Contracts Remain Unchanged

All existing API endpoints, request/response schemas, and data formats will remain exactly the same. The internationalization changes are purely frontend UI text changes that do not affect backend APIs.

### Frontend-Only Changes

The following changes are frontend-only:
- Converting all Chinese UI text to English
- Removing the "Copy to SQL Editor" button from the AI agent
- Updating README documentation files

### No New API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are needed to support this feature. All existing functionality remains intact with only language text changes.

### No Modified API Endpoints

No existing API endpoints need modification. The backend behavior remains identical, with only frontend text presentation changing.

### Conclusion

Since this feature is purely a UI internationalization and documentation update, no API contract changes are required. All existing API documentation and schemas remain valid and unchanged.
